Industrial Project and Design, LLC has been a technical service business since 2000. Together, we created a streamlined website for prospective clients to learn more about them.

The site was built to be lightweight by strictly using HTML5 and CSS3, with the heaviest part being a PHP-powered contact form. The site is also responsive which has breakpoints for when the content is interrupted by the browser window.
