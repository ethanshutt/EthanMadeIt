Preview: For the Murray State Monster Mash, an annual print sale and fundraiser, I created a series of advertisements to spread the word.

Sidebar: (link: https://www.instagram.com/msu_printmaking/ text:MSU Printmaking) hosts a Halloween print sale every year and I was asked to create a few promotional materials that could be handed out and hung around campus.

It was important to me to have a *face* to the event promotions, and since I don't often get to illustrate a character or person, I wanted to have some fun with how some of the facial features could be identifiers.

Every Halloween event has to have a monster mascot right? I created this nerdy little ghoul to sort of play on our group of students in the print department.

When Stranger Things first debuted on Netflix, there was a lot of fanfare for the vintage introduction credits. For these runs of ads, I wanted to jump into the mix by using ITC Benguiat â€“ hoping both fans of the newest binge-worthy show and old-time movie buffs would recognize the typeface enough to stop by.

We wanted to also have a few versions that could be screen printed, so I took my nerdy ghoul and another student's character and converted the pair into a half-tone for print.
