Title: Cavaliers NBA Championship Poster

----

Type: Print

----

Preview: In honor of the greatest comeback in NBA Finals history, I designed and screen-printed a poster that calls back to Cleveland's gritty nature.

----

Sidebar: The Cleveland Cavaliers won their first NBA Championship thanks to the only 3-1 comeback in NBA Finals history. I thought it would be fun to make a 6-color screen printed poster that would commemorate their accomplishment.
