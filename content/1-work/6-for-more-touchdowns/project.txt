----

Type: Digital

Preview: I completed an internship with the Murray State Football team where I created several informational graphics that could be shared during recruiting efforts.

Sidebar: 

Murray State Football is a time-honored tradition in the Ohio-Valley Conference. Since 1941, when Murray State helped found the conference, the team has won 8 conference championships, participated in the first bowl game by an OVC member, and had numerous players succeed in the NFL.

During the summer of 2014 I was tasked with creating graphics for the team's social media pages during recruitment.

## The goal: build a winning system
First, I wanted to be sure that I could create graphics that accomplished a few main goals:
 1. Must match Murray State Athletics Guidelines
 2. Accent the team's momentum (link: #winning-formula class: small text: huh?)
 3. Be flexible

## The elephant in the room {#winning-formula}
Murray State's Football team was in the middle of a culture change. The team compiled a **3-9** record the previous year and brought in some great new coaching talent. Our goal was to take that momentum and use that as the face of the recruitment campaign.

First things first, I needed to put a spotlight on the new coaching staff.

## Coach Mitch Stewart

Mitch Stewart was named head coach after proving that he ran a potent offense as a coordinator at Murray State. 

We highlighted that he favored a passing attack capable of being a nearly league-leading offense.

## Coach Chris Boone

Chris Boone was a new hire from Samford University where he coached one of the best FCS offenses in 2013-14. 

Again, we highlighted the coaching style: aggressive, stout defenses where players would be given the ability to make a play.

We also wrote copy and taglines that would accompany these graphics with the intent to show players they could succeed once they were in the Murray State football system.

## Tradition is a selling point
Finally, I rounded out the remainder of the series with graphics that showcased the tradition of Murray State that is unique to its campus.
