I would hesitate to call this a blog as much as I would hesitate to call myself a writer. This page will act as a hub for some of my various thoughts,  findings, or ramblings. Be on the lookout for subjects ranging from life and design to current events and occasional site updates.

To keep up with me on a more regular basis follow me on (twitter:ethanmadeit text:Twitter).

Feel free to reach out for more information or to give your thoughts–I always enjoy learning from different perspectives.
