# Ethan Made It v4.0 Rebuild
After several busy months, settling into a new house, getting a pupper, and numerous other excuses I let my site fall into disarray.

My hosting expired which means it is probably time for a restart here, so I'm going to make a few changes for the better on the newest revision.

## Checklist:
- **Static Site:** First things first, I'm switching to either Gatsby or Eleventy and building the site staticly. I've enjoyed my love affair with Kirby CMS and will often use it in the future, but all good things must have an end.

- **Larger Emphasis on Writing:** I plan to write more in the coming year and I will need a lucky place to house these thoughts.

- **Update Portfolio:** This should be a given, I need to actually update this and include my most recent projects.

- **Simplify Layout:** If only for the first versionâ€“it just needs to work and work _well._
