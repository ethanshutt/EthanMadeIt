            <h2 class="text-color__light-grey">I’m a designer, developer, and marketer making things for print and the web.</h2>
            <p>I studied at Murray State University and received a Bachelor of Fine Arts with an emphasis in Graphic design. Since then, I’ve spent the last four years honing my skills in design and marketing with freelance clients and day-to-day at Hunt Ford Chrysler.</p>
            <p>My primary focuses are helping companies match their brands to their ideal culture, building lean and responsive websites, and creating content that informs buyers.</p>
            <p>I’m also passionate about <a href="/bookshelf">reading</a>, <a href="/to-share">sharing information</a>, and travel.</p>
