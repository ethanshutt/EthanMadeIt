It’s official now, I guess.

I am going to stick with this iteration of the site for now. This commit will be the last one before merging over into the `master` branch on Github.

This site is still a work in progress and is in no way complete but, I do feel like it is in a _usable_ state.

One new thing I want to try is to give a write-up with every major change. This idea is taken from Johnnie Hallman and how [he’s treating his new site update](https://destroytoday.com/).

I really like the idea behind it: **learning and building in public**. 

I am starting this post a bit later in the process than he did, and here is a general rundown of where the site is at.

The site is running on an Eleventy backend.
