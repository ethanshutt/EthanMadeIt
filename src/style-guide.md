Here's a rough style guide for the site.
## Design
### Font Usage
There are three font variables available.

**Monospace** is exclusively used for code, and computer input related text.

**Font-Sans** is used primarily for navigating the site (e.g. homepage link lists, site navigation).

**Font-Serif** is used for the remainder of the content.

### Typography



## Content

### Goals for content
I'd eventually like to **own my content**. This means I'd like to leverage the pagination ability of eleventy to bring tweets, posts, images that I have created on the web and house them all locally here.

### URL Sentencing
**Base URL:** `ethanmade.it` (home)
- `/for` (work)
    - `/for/fun` (personal projects)
    - `/for/work` (work)
        - `/for/his-hometown`
        - `/for/the-local-library`
        - `/for/monster-mash`
- `/in-writing` (writing)
    - `/in-writing/about` (tags)
    - `/from-2019-to-2020` (post)
    - `/pretty-far-with-html-css` (post)

- `/with` (resources)

- `/personal` (about)
- `/to-talk` (contact)
- `/shareable` (feed)
- `/old` (archive)
