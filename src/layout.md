Here's a rough idea of how I want the site URL to work

`ethanmade.it`(home)
- `/for` (work)
    - `/for/fun` (personal projects)
    - `/for/work` (work)
        - `/for/his-hometown`
        - `/for/the-local-library`
        - `/for/monster-mash`
- `/think` (writing)
    - `/think/about` (tags)
    - `/from-2019-to-2020` (posts)
    - `/pretty-far-with-html-css`

- `/personal` (about)
- `/talk` (contact)
- `/shareable` (feed)
- `/old` (archive)
