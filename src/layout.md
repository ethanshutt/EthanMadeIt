Here's a rough style guide for the site.
## Design
### Font Usage
There are three font variables available.

**Monospace** is exclusively used for code, and computer input related text.

**Font-Sans** is used primarily for navigating the site (e.g. homepage link lists, site navigation).

**Font-Serif** is used for the remainder of the content.

## Content
