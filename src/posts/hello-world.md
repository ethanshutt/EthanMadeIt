It’s official now, I guess.

This commit will be the last one before merging over into the `master` branch on Github. This site is still a work in progress and is in no way complete but, I do feel like it is in a _usable_ state. A new thing I want to try is to give a write-up with every major change. This idea is taken from Jonnie Hallman and how [he’s treating his new site update](https://destroytoday.com/). I really like the idea behind it: **learning and building in public**. 

The site is running on an Eleventy back end. I rolled my own starter kit from scratch in order to learn how to use it. It’s called [Journal](https://github.com/ethanshutt/journal). Currently I have a working blog, a functional [404 page](/404), syntax-highlighting with PrismJS, and an in-progress [bookshelf](/bookshelf).

There's plenty I’d like to add to this site and the list includes:

- Portfolio (obviously)
- [Twitter Data](https://www.zachleat.com/web/own-my-tweets/)
- Designate a spot for "articles" and "notes"
- Lazy load all images
- Media Embeds (YouTube, CodePen, GitHub Gists)

I’m excited with the direction and having fun with the process so stay tuned.
