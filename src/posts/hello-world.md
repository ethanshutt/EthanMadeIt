It’s official now, I guess.

This commit will be the last one before merging over into the `master` branch on Github. This site is still a work in progress and is in no way complete but, I do feel like it is in a _usable_ state. A new thing I want to try is to give a write-up with every major change. This idea is taken from Jonnie Hallman and how [he’s treating his new site update](https://destroytoday.com/). I really like the idea behind it: **learning and building in public**. 

I am starting this post a bit later in the process than he did, so here is a general rundown of where the site is at.

The site is running on an Eleventy back end. I rolled my own starter kit from scratch in order to learn how to use it. It’s called [Journal](https://github.com/ethanshutt/journal). Currently I have a working blog, an [about page](/personal) (albeit one with old copy), and a functional [404 page](/404).
