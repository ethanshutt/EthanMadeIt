# I'm a designer making things for print and the web.

Iâ€™m Ethan, a designer from a small town in western Kentucky. Currently, I work with Hunt Ford Chrysler in Franklin, KY where I am translating my creative background into a marketing-driven role to help us lead our region in sales.

I also occasionally write about work, design, and life.

Before that, I graduated from Murray State University with a BFA emphasizing in Graphic Design. While there, I designed a fictional hiking company, and did an internship with a college football team.
