It’s late on Sunday evening and we’ve just finished eating dinner. I’ve thought a lot about the news of Kobe Bryant’s passing today, and as an avid basketball fan, I really hated to hear it. Kobe Bryant was a legend on the court, and I was very excited to see what he would do off of the court.

## As simple as necessary (but not simpler)
Seth Godin is a giant. He spends his time writing, teaching, and helping folks learn how to be their best self in business. From time to time I‘ll find one of his articles that really resonates with me. The most recent example is a reminder that sometimes simplicity is the best policy–but there can be a limit.
>“As simple as necessary” is missed by many professionals who should call themselves designers, but don’t. Consider the 30 digit code that Microsoft wants me to type in… 30 digits? That’s more than a quintillion possible combinations. A lot more. Why?

Writing CSS isn‘t particularly hard; what makes it difficult is keeping it organized and functional over time. We‘ve all had files that start off with good intentions and then watch as they slowly blossom out of control.

## Outside the web

The world was strange this week, between [impeachment trials](https://www.npr.org/2020/02/01/801694891/impeachment-trial-heads-toward-finish-line-after-witness-vote-fails), [countries breaking away](https://www.npr.org/2020/01/31/801574310/the-long-uneasy-wait-is-over-parties-protests-and-solemn-silence-greet-brexit), and [the newest health emergency](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/01/31/801686524/trump-declares-coronavirus-a-public-health-emergency-and-restricts-travel-from-c) it seemed likely that the world would call it quits over this weekend. Here are some of the things that helped distract me from the constant barrage of bad.

### Why is Joe Rogan So Popular?

Joe Rogan is everywhere for some reason. He has such a diverse group of acquaintances that you might find him in the background of pop culture for no other reason than he wanted to be there. His podcast is pretty much the most popular thing on any podcast app, and you've probably seen the one with him and Elon Musk smoking weed.

Listen, I‘ve been cooking **a lot** here lately. It‘s mostly from the desire to keep making things with my hands but I also give 60% of the credit to this YouTube channel. 

BonAppetit has some of the best hosts, chefs, and content on the platform and I would watch this stuff for hours. Anything is good, but I will never skip a video with both Brad Leone and Claire Saffitz. Seriously, if you are remotely interested in cooking, check out the stuff that they do.
