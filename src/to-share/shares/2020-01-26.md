It’s late on Sunday evening and we’ve just finished eating dinner. I’ve thought a lot about the news of Kobe Bryant’s passing today, and as an avid basketball fan, I really hated to hear it. Kobe Bryant was a legend on the court, and I was very excited to see what he would do off of the court.

## Dear Basketball

In the spirit of his memory I wanted to share Kobe’s award winning short film, *Dear Basketball*. It’s a love letter that feels familiar to anyone who is passionate about what they do. There are seasons in life, and one can only hope to come as graceful an end as Kobe’s career.

Amelia Wattenberger is a front-end developer at Parse.ly and created [this great article](https://wattenberger.com/blog/css-cascade) that helps people understand exactly how the specificity system in CSS works.

## Web Typography

Web typography can be tough, here are a few sites that have helped me learn better practices this week.

### Zell Liew‘s Mastering Responive Typography

Zell Liew is another front-end developer who is helping to teach JavaScript and web typography though a few simple courses. Admittedly, I’ve not signed up for the course but I have signed up for the newsletter where he shares some of his basic tips. I have already learned some great tricks that I will use often from it.

### Simplified Fluid Type

CSS Tricks is awesome. This week I stumbled across [this article](https://css-tricks.com/simplified-fluid-typography/) (and a series of articles linked therein) that discuss the idea of scaling the font size of type as the viewport changes size. Using some newer CSS tech, Chris Coyier takes a look at what is possible right now and one day.

That‘s all for this week!
